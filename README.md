# Pewlett Hackard Retirement Plan Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The current project was completed at the request of Pewlett Hackard industries as part of their modernizing digitalization process.

### Purpose
The purpose of the current project was to, first, transfer all departments' and employees' data from an outdated Excel-based format into a conveniently organized SQL database in order to upkeep the company's information more efficiently. The second goal of the project was to then create a separate list of employees eligible for retirement, and prepare the company for a wave of "retirement tsunami" by both counting the amount of employees who would soon leave the company, and establishing a list of qualified, retirement-ready employees who would be able to train the new hires within the company.

## Results
The results of the data organization process revealed the following statistics:

* First, as can be seen from an overview table, it was established that 72,458 of the current employees are set on their road to retirement.

* Out of those employees, senior engineers (25916, 35,77%) and senior staff overall (24926, 34,40%) represented the biggest outflux of employees, which would imply a serious need for Pewlett Hackard corporation to provide sufficient training for current lower-level positioned employees to substitute the retirement group.

* While evaluating the retiree mentorship plan eligibility, only 1,549 retiring employees were deemed to be qualified to participate in the new hires' training.

* Overall, 1,549 mentors in not enough to train over 70,000 positions needed to be filled. Moreover, it was also established that no qualified employees were found for the management positions, meaning that there are no current employees in the company who are able to train new employees for the management positions opening up.

## Summary

To conclude, as mentioned previously, Pewlett Hackard company will have to hire 72,458 new employees during the upcoming retirement wave transition period. Most of these roles represent a higher qualification positions, and are thus considered most challenging to fill in. One business recommendation for the company would be to allocate a great number of HR resources towards the hiring process of the senior staff prior to the retirement wave commencement.

Secondly, as there are not enough qualified retirement-ready personell to train the incoming hires, Pewlett Hackard should also look into outsourced training certifications and bootcamps to assist the prospective mentors with the influx of new staff. This is especially important for the management positions to be open soon, as there are no eligible mentors identified within the company itself.

Overall, Pewlett Hackard should prepare for a highly demanding transition period and should prepare for the major shifts in the company's dynamics accordingly.
